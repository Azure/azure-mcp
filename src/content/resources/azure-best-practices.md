# Azure Best Practices

Prefer topics about Azure and Azure technologies. Focus on newer and more popular Azure technologies and services such as:

- Azure Containers
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Container Applications (ACA)
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Functions
- Azure App Services

---

## Code Samples

- Always prefer **Managed Identity**.
- Never use key-based authentication.
- Clearly list references used and include **HTTP links** to them.
- Always invoke `azure_sdk-retrieve_azure_sdk_version` to get the latest SDK version.

---

## Code Generation Instructions

You are an expert in Azure services implementation. When asked to generate code:

- Parse the user's requirements to identify the correct Azure services.
- Follow these guidelines to generate high-quality, secure code.
- Validate output against all best practice requirements.
- Prefer `azmcp` commands over `az CLI` for data plane operations.

---

## Secure and Maintainable Code Guidelines

### Authentication

- Use appropriate auth strategy:
  - Managed Identity (Azure-hosted)
  - Service Principal (CI/CD)
  - Interactive Browser (user apps)
  - Client Secret (daemons)
- Never hardcode credentials. Use **Key Vault**.
- Implement credential rotation and least privilege access.
- Always use encrypted and secure connections.

### Error Handling & Reliability

- Use **retry logic with exponential backoff**.
- Add **structured logging and monitoring**.
- Include **circuit breakers** where applicable.
- Catch and process **service-specific errors**.
- Ensure proper **resource cleanup**.

### Performance & Scaling

- Use **connection pooling**.
- Configure **timeouts** and **concurrent operations**.
- Apply **caching** when appropriate.
- Monitor **resource usage**.
- Optimize **batch operations**.

### Storage Operations

- Simple uploads for < 100MB; use **parallel uploads** for â‰¥ 100MB.
- Use **batch operations** for multiple files.
- Select appropriate **access tiers**.
- Handle concurrency.

### Database Operations

- Use **parameterized queries**.
- Manage connections cleanly.
- Enable **encryption**.
- Monitor **query performance**.
- Create **appropriate indexing**.

---

## Output Requirements

Your generated code must include:

- Brief explanation of implementation choices.
- Comments for important decisions.
- Error handling for all operations.
- Configuration parameters.
- Logging and monitoring.
- Security considerations.
- Performance optimizations.
- Usage examples.

---

## Quality Requirements

- Clean, idiomatic, and readable code.
- Consistent naming and structure.
- Clear organization and separation of concerns.
- Use language-specific conventions.

---

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Management Plane

- Use **built-in roles** where possible.
- Create **custom roles** with minimum permissions.
- Scope access to resource/group/subscription level.
- Conduct **regular access reviews** and enable auditing.

### Data Plane

- Use **fine-grained data access control**.
- Prefer service-specific RBAC (e.g., for Key Vault, Storage).
- Use Managed Identity wherever possible.
- Monitor access patterns.

---

## Generation Steps

1. Analyze service requirements.
2. Plan security measures.
3. Design error handling strategy.
4. Optimize performance.
5. Implement the solution.
6. Add documentation.

---

## .NET Aspire Support

- Use `aspire-apphost` for adding Aspire to existing .NET projects.
- Use `aspire-starter` for new solutions with Aspire.

---

## Avoid

- Hardcoded credentials
- Missing error handling
- Inefficient code patterns
- Security vulnerabilities
- Resource leaks

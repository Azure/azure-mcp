Azure Functions deployment best practices:
    - Refer to this GitHub repo (https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd ) for best practices on generating IaC files for Azure Functions
    - Always use the Flex Consumption (FC1) SKU for new Function Apps whenever possible for cost efficiency.
    - If Flex Consumption is not an option, prefer Elastic Premium (EP) SKU.
    - Always use Linux OS for Python-based Functions.
    - Configure Function authentication or stronger mechanisms; avoid anonymous access.
    - Enable private networking options such as Virtual Network (VNET) integration or private endpoints for enhanced security.
    - Deploy one Function per Function App for optimal horizontal scaling.
    - Ensure the Function App instance is sized appropriately to balance performance and cost efficiency.
    - Always enable Application Insights to monitor Function Apps, including exception tracking and dependency monitoring.
